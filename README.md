This code for Tetris Game was made by Chi Mai and Mia Tran as a final project for Smith College Spring 24' CSC110 (Section 1) course.

We make the game as a clone to the famous Tetris game, using graphics module from Python. The game has a similar rule as a normal Tetris game:

1. Players use arrows to move the blocks left (left arrow), right (right arrow), and drop down faster (down arrow).
2. Use space bar to rotate the block.
3. If one row of block is filled, the row disappears and players gain 100 points.
4. If a block reaches the top of the screen, game over and players' scores are recorded on the leaderboard.
